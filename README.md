# AI Reading Comprehension Worksheet Generator

A polished, classroom-ready reading comprehension worksheet that you can generate **in seconds** with this AI agent powered by GPT-4. An AI-generated story that can be however long you want it to be, with a layered set of short and long answer questions whose depth scales with your class's grade, and a vocabulary page listing the passage's most advanced terms with definitions and example sentences. 

🔎 [View a full sample student worksheet (PDF)](Worksheets/G8%20-%20Notebook%20on%20the%20Windowsill.pdf)

Each worksheet ships in two matching editions: a **student edition** with clean handwriting-ready answer lines beneath every question, and a **teacher edition** with a concise bullet-point answer key in place of the lines (claim, evidence, and analysis at the higher grades). Both are PDFs, ready to print and hand out to a class.

```

Set your OpenAI API key:

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-proj-..."
```

Then launch one of:

```bash
python gui.py     # windowed GUI
python main.py    # terminal CLI
```

## Build a standalone .exe (Windows)
